            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The Livability Score is a score out of 100 designed to help people evaluate the quality of an area. It
                includes 9 categories and data from multiple datasets, ranking over 45,000 locations.</p>

            <p>Each category (amenities, commute, cost of living, crime, employment, health & safety, housing, schools
                and user ratings) is scored individually based on data in the methodology below. A letter grade is
                assigned to each category in order to easily evaluate the score.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>A+: 83–100 A: 80–82 A-: 77–79</li>
                <li>B+: 74–76 B: 71–73 B: -68–70</li>
                <li>C+: 65–67 C: 62–64 C: -59–61</li>
                <li>D+: 56–58 D: 53–55</li>
                <li>D-: 50–52 F: 0–49</li>

            <h2>Categories</h2>
            <article>

                <p>The amenities score provides an overview of the availability of local amenities in close proximity
                    to an area. The algorithm searches for all amenities in the categories below within a 2 mile/3km (30
                    minute walk) radius to the center point of a location. Higher scores are awarded to the areas with
                    the most nearby amenities from each of the following categories.</p>

                <p>The commute score provides an overview of the availability of local public transportation as well as
                    the average commute times to work. The commute score is based on the accessability to nearby public
                    transit stops, average commute times to work and the percentage of people who take public transit to
                    work. The overall score is calculated based on comparison to the national average.</p>

                <h3>Cost of Living</h3>
                <p>The cost of living score provides an overview of the affordability of an area. The score takes into
                    account the overall cost of living index (goods and services, housing, groceries, utilities,
                    transportation and health care) as well as the state/provincial sales tax and income tax rates. The
                    overall score is calculated based on comparison to the national average.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Overall cost of living index (85% of the cost of living score).</li>

                    theft). Higher weights are given to violent crimes as they are more severe. For comparison purposes,
                    crime rates are normalized per 100,000 residents. The overall score is calculated based on
                    comparison to the national average.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Violent Crime: 65%</li>

                    safety facilities nearby. The health & safety score is based on the median air quality and the
                    accessability to facilities such as hospitals, clinics, doctors, pharmacies, dentists, nursing
                    homes, police and fire stations. The overall score is calculated based on comparison to the national

                    area. Housing affordability measures the median home and rent price to household income ratio, lower

                    receive higher scores) complete the rest of the score. The overall score is calculated based on
                    comparison to the national average.</p>
